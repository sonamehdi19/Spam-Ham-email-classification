In this problem, a NLP model is built for the process of classifying emails as spam or not spam. This is called Spam Detection, and it is a binary classification problem.The reason to do this is simple: by detecting unsolicited and unwanted emails, we can prevent spam messages from creeping into the userâ€™s inbox, thereby improving user experience.
